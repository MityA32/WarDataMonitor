To-do list: Tasks to make the project ready for publishing in the App Store as a commercial product.

After finishing working on the project, you have to check one more time, if your app matches all Apple Guidelines.

	application, Info.plist, and also
	mapping files symbols

• Export settings and automatic checks

	• Selection of distribution type

	debugging

	• Selection of certificate and profile
